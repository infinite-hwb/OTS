**Acknowledgments**

This project has been greatly influenced by the foundational work of numerous researchers in the field. In particular, we would like to express our gratitude to:

•	Osokin, Sumin, and Lomakin, for their paper "Os2d: One-stage one-shot object detection by matching anchor features", presented at the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020, pages 635-652. Their work provided invaluable insights and methodologies that significantly influenced the development of our code.

•	Jaderberg, Simonyan, and Zisserman, for their groundbreaking research presented in "Spatial transformer networks", published in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, vol. 2, pages 2017–2025, 2015. Their innovative ideas have formed a substantial part of the backbone of our project.

We also want to extend our appreciation to all other researchers whose work contributes directly or indirectly to this project. Their pioneering contributions to the field have laid the groundwork for our exploration and development.

This project would not have been possible without their valuable contributions, and for that, we are deeply grateful.
